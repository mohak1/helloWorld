first repository 
Hello everybody!
My name is Mohak and i'm learning to code. I created a GitHub account because i think it'll help me become a better programmer by contributing to prjects made by other people. I code in C, C++ and C#, planning to learn pyhton next after gaining mastry over C++.
This place seems fun!
